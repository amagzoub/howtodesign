							<h2>Context and Culture</h2>

							<center><em>anatomy of desk lamps</em> vs. <em>basement lighting.</em></center>

									<h3>Desk Lamp Anatomy</h3>

										<h4>Sketch of lamp structure</h4>
										<p>A basic desk lamp has three main components: the head, neck and base. The design of these three interfaces depend on the design intent, function and form language expressed and set by the designer.</p>
										<p>Below are three images of different lamps. At first sight, they look very different, however the main structural components are there. They have three different form languages that are carried out across their designs that follow their functions. For example, the one on the left is modern and angular. The middle one is more conventional and expresses versatility. The right one expresses fragility and delicateness. </p>

							<h3>Basements</h3>
								<p>What's the first word you associate with your basement? Dark? Scary? Dank? For this assignment I wanted to explore our house basement and understand why that is the case. I took a few photos to highlight how light travels across the room and chose elements that represent the space and how they appear under such lighting. I also took photos of the basement next door that recently got renovated and compared it to ours.</p>

							<h3>Design Selection</h3>
							I decided to go with an interactive wall that displays information of a space's usage. My inspiration was <a href = "http://dobpler.com/">this previous project</a>. The designer used an interactive wall to allow users to create shapes and project themselves onto this wall. My idea was to iterate on that further and use color, with this type of wall technology, to display usage of a space such as a hallway etc.

							<h2>Mid-Review</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
							Based on my concept I wanted to iterate on different types of interactive modules. I've been using an ultrasonic sensor, HR-S04 to turn on and off an RGB LED based on distance.
							</p>
						</article>
				</div>
			</section>
			<br>
			<p>
			To prepare for the midreivew, I attempted to test out different distance sensors to active an LED to detect when a user is in proximity. I'm fond of pixels, so I cut out a few "pixels" from foamcore to test for size and made a series of grids.

			In parallel, I was testing out a circuit and program that will allow an LED to turn on when in certain proximity of the an ultrosonic sensor, HR-S04.

							<h2>Week 8 - Collaboration</h2>

							This week, we've gathered the input from Mid-Week to improve our designs. We've also been asked to gain additional input from users or others to help improve our designs. As a result, I shifted my application from an LED panel, to LED blocks as I explain below.

							My final product as in the video above is a set of independent "programmable" shelves; smart shelves. They connect to a computer via Arduino and using Matlab, I'm able to look up items on these shelves via a pre-programmed directory. Although the demonstration and implementation at this stage is quite simple, many levels of complexity. 

							Options to make this system more robust are:
								<ul>
									<li>Allowing the the interface between the computer and shelves be wireless instead of wired.</li>
									<li>Making the system cross-platoform.</li>
									<li>Allowing the objects to "dock" in place and automatically update the directory.</li>
									<li> ... and many other functionalities.</li>
								</ul>
