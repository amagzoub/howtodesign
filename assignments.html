							<h2>Week 2 - Context and Culture</h2>

							<p>This week we were assigned to choose the context that we want to work in. I had two competing ideas:

									<h3>Desk Lamp Anatomy</h3>
									<p>I wanted to identify the basic components of a lamp were. After which, I would compare across different lamps and observe the similarities and differences between these designs. Below is my research and findings.</p>

										<h4>Sketch of lamp structure</h4>
										<p>A basic desk lamp has three main components: the head, neck and base. The design of these three interfaces depend on the design intent, function and form language expressed and set by the designer.</p>
										<p>Below are three images of different lamps. At first sight, they look very different, however the main structural components are there. They have three different form languages that are carried out across their designs that follow their functions. For example, the one on the left is modern and angular. The middle one is more conventional and expresses versatility. The right one expresses fragility and delicateness. </p>

							<h3>Basements</h3>
								<p>What's the first word you associate with your basement? Dark? Scary? Dank? For this assignment I wanted to explore our house basement and understand why that is the case. I took a few photos to highlight how light travels across the room and chose elements that represent the space and how they appear under such lighting. I also took photos of the basement next door that recently got renovated and compared it to ours.</p>

							After much thought, I decided to go with an interactive wall that displays information of a space's usage. My inspiration was <a href = "video/dobplerNordichi2006.mov">this previous project</a>.

							Based on my concept I wanted to iterate on different types of interactive modules. I've been using an ultrasonic sensor, HR-S04 to turn on and off an RGB LED based on distance.Here are a <a href = "https://youtu.be/35maO7r7QPM">couple</a> <a href = "https://youtu.be/gM9j6EoZFbI">links</a> to my tests.

							This week, we've gathered the input from Mid-Week to improve our designs. We've also been asked to gain additional input from users or others to help improve our designs. As a result, I shifted my application from an LED panel, to LED blocks as I explain below.
