										<h4>Sketch of lamp structure</h4>
										<p>A basic desk lamp has three main components: the head, neck and base. The design of these three interfaces depend on the design intent, function and form language expressed and set by the designer.</p>
										<p>Below are three images of different lamps. At first sight, they look very different, however the main structural components are there. They have three different form languages that are carried out across their designs that follow their functions. For example, the one on the left is modern and angular. The middle one is more conventional and expresses versatility. The right one expresses fragility and delicateness. </p>

								<p>What's the first word you associate with your basement? Dark? Scary? Dank? For this assignment I wanted to explore our house basement and understand why that is the case. I took a few photos to highlight how light travels across the room and chose elements that represent the space and how they appear under such lighting. I also took photos of the basement next door that recently got renovated and compared it to ours.</p>

							<h3>Design Selection</h3>
							I decided to go with an interactive wall that displays information of a space's usage. My inspiration was <a href = "http://dobpler.com/">this previous project</a>. The designer used an interactive wall to allow users to create shapes and project themselves onto this wall. My idea was to iterate on that further and use color, with this type of wall technology, to display usage of a space such as a hallway etc.

							<h2>Mid-Review</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
							Based on my concept I wanted to iterate on different types of interactive modules. I've been using an ultrasonic sensor, HR-S04 to turn on and off an RGB LED based on distance.
							</p>
						</article>
				</div>
			</section>
			<br>
			<p>
			To prepare for the midreivew, I attempted to test out different distance sensors to active an LED to detect when a user is in proximity. I'm fond of pixels, so I cut out a few "pixels" from foamcore to test for size and made a series of grids.

			In parallel, I was testing out a circuit and program that will allow an LED to turn on when in certain proximity of the an ultrosonic sensor, HR-S04.

							<h2>Collaboration</h2>

							<p>
							I've merged the last few weeks of the semester to this section to summarize the direction I was going in. My project at this point has pivoted again slightly, and I'll take you through the various changes that are about to happen, through final presentation. :)

			After gathereing input from mid-review to improve our designs, I've shifted my application from an LED panel, to LED blocks. The idea is to make interactive "objects" that the user already owns in some sense. My idea was this could be in the form of storage "blocks", that could be stacked into the shape of a table or bookshelf, for example. </p>

			These storage boxes will allow the user to use them as normal units, but with the added functionality of embeded LEDs and sensor to tell usage using color. The more often a "box" is used, the redder it's color would be. Nonusage will result in a blue hue. This color scheme is inspired by "hot and cold".</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The following video show my attempts to get this effect. I used a motion sensor <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/189">(PIR)</a> to detect the motion. (The second video is just a fun video with party lights :D).

			The flashing blue effect was just to get a more distinct change in state when testing. In future iterations I was planning on making the change more smooth and subtle, but slowly fading from a blue to a red color without disturbing the user.

			The next step was to case these lights. I purchased clear and translucent acrylic, and made finger joints to attach and glue the assemble the box. As shown in the images below. However, when I tried placing the system above inside the box, the PIR sensor could not sense through acrylic.</p>

			After conversing with my instructors, I wanted to pivot slightly: why not use the added light functionality to help locate objects inside these "boxes/shelves"? This defined the finalized version of my project.</p>
			<p> Here's a collection of sketches that I made to depict the shape I would like my final product to be. I settled on cubes, a) for the pixelation aspect that I have been following throughout the semester and b) cubes are the simplest indpendent shapes that can be stacked and also act as indpendents and I wanted my "book cases" to serve as such.</p>

			<p> "My product is a set of "smart" shelves. They are programmable and are linked to a directory. A user logs into an interface (such as a laptop or mobile app) and searches the item (e.g. book) they would like to find. The respective shelf where it's located lights up. This is via an Arduino system and a Matlab interface." </p>

						<div> <p> I've also had a conversation with MIT Museum Director, Deborah Douglas, who I spoke with about current storage and organization methods. She talked about the need for an identifiable marker to "dock" books and other museum items, especially in large storage facilities when artefacts are off-display. We also talked about different scenarios where this kind of smart system would be helpful, such as a grocery store, where someoene's hired to purchase groceries at obsucre markets and would quickly like to locate items in the unfamiliar place. It's also useful in bookstores where the customers do not necessarily would like to ask the clerks for help locating items and can locate the items independently.</p>
						<p>In parallel, I've built a cube shelf and used butt joints to join the walls. I made an 1/4" wide dado groove (shown in the image to the left), 1/8" deep on the table saw to allow for an LED strip to be placed. The box is 11 5/8" tall and 12" wide. </p>

			<p> At this point, I have finalized my design. I was to create four units 12 1/2"x11 7/8" with and overall dado, 1" offset from teh front. This groove will be 1/8" deep to allow for sanded 1/8" acrylic to be placed. There's another inner groove to allow for ~16" of led strip to be embedded in. I bought two colors, warm white and red. This assembly is to create a nice finished look where the shelf looks like an ordinary shelf and the light is only noticable when turned on.</p>
			<p> The joints between the walls was changed from simple butt joints, to rabbet joints too allow for anotehr internal groove, for the wiroing to exit from the back of the shelf, without compromizing the frame.</p>
			<p> Lastly, I used 3/4" birch plywood as a material, cut it on the table saw to length, and made all the rabbet/dado features, and then glued the pieces together. I then sanded it carefully, laser cut and sanded 1/8" clear acrylic to length, soldered the led strip and wired it through the each box, and glued all the pieces together. At the back where all the corners with wires meet, I attached an Uno arduino board, that was connected to my laptop via cable. I then ran a Matlab script that will deliver a HIGH output to a pin (connected to individual shelf) associated with the shelf of interest. (where the book/item is located). This demo is shown in my video below.

							My final product as in the video above is a set of independent "programmable" shelves; smart shelves. They connect to a computer via Arduino and using Matlab, I'm able to look up items on these shelves via a pre-programmed directory. Although the demonstration and implementation at this stage is quite simple, many levels of complexity. 

							Options to make this system more robust are:
								<ul>
									<li>Allowing the the interface between the computer and shelves be wireless instead of wired.</li>
									<li>Making the system cross-platoform.</li>
									<li>Allowing the objects to "dock" in place and automatically update the directory.</li>
								</ul>
