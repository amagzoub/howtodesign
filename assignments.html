							<h2>Context and Culture</h2>

									<h3>Desk Lamp Anatomy</h3>
									<p>I wanted to identify the basic components of a lamp were. After which, I would compare across different lamps and observe the similarities and differences between these designs. Below is my research and findings.</p>

										<h4>Sketch of lamp structure</h4>
										<p>A basic desk lamp has three main components: the head, neck and base. The design of these three interfaces depend on the design intent, function and form language expressed and set by the designer.</p>
										<p>Below are three images of different lamps. At first sight, they look very different, however the main structural components are there. They have three different form languages that are carried out across their designs that follow their functions. For example, the one on the left is modern and angular. The middle one is more conventional and expresses versatility. The right one expresses fragility and delicateness. </p>

								<p>What's the first word you associate with your basement? Dark? Scary? Dank? For this assignment I wanted to explore our house basement and understand why that is the case. I took a few photos to highlight how light travels across the room and chose elements that represent the space and how they appear under such lighting. I also took photos of the basement next door that recently got renovated and compared it to ours.</p>

							<p> I wanted to know what kind of light inspired objects that I can add to my basement that will change the mood/ it's usage.

							<h3>Design Selection</h3>
							I decided to go with an interactive wall that displays information of a space's usage. My inspiration was <a href = "http://dobpler.com/">this previous project</a>. The designer used an interactive wall to allow users to create shapes and project themselves onto this wall. My idea was to iterate on that further and use color, with this type of wall technology, to display usage of a space such as a hallway etc.

							<h2>Mid-Review</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
							Based on my concept I wanted to iterate on different types of interactive modules. I've been using an ultrasonic sensor, HR-S04 to turn on and off an RGB LED based on distance.
							</p>
						</article>
				</div>
			</section>
			<br>
			<p>
			To prepare for the midreivew, I attempted to test out different distance sensors to active an LED to detect when a user is in proximity. I'm fond of pixels, so I cut out a few "pixels" from foamcore to test for size and made a series of grids.

			In parallel, I was testing out a circuit and program that will allow an LED to turn on when in certain proximity of the an ultrosonic sensor, HR-S04.

							<h2>Collaboration</h2>
						</header>
							<p>
							I've merged the last few weeks of the semester to this section to summarize the direction I was going in. My project at this point has pivoted again slightly, and I'll take you through the various changes that are about to happen, through final presentation. :)

			After gathereing input from mid-review to improve our designs, I've shifted my application from an LED panel, to LED blocks. The idea is to make interactive "objects" that the user already owns in some sense. My idea was this could be in the form of storage "blocks", that could be stacked into the shape of a table or bookshelf, for example. </p>

				<div class="row 50% uniform">
						<div class="6u"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Box_Test/IMG_1892.JPG" alt="" /></span></div>

			These storage boxes will allow the user to use them as normal units, but with the added functionality of embeded LEDs and sensor to tell usage using color. The more often a "box" is used, the redder it's color would be. Nonusage will result in a blue hue. This color scheme is inspired by "hot and cold".</p>
			<br>
			<p>
			The following video show my attempts to get this effect. I used a motion sensor <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/189">(PIR)</a> to detect the motion. (The second video is just a fun video with party lights :D).

			The flashing blue effect was just to get a more distinct change in state when testing. In future iterations I was planning on making the change more smooth and subtle, but slowly fading from a blue to a red color without disturbing the user.

			The next step was to case these lights. I purchased clear and translucent acrylic, and made finger joints to attach and glue the assemble the box. As shown in the images below. However, when I tried placing the system above inside the box, the PIR sensor could not sense through acrylic.</p>

			After conversing with my instructors, I wanted to pivot slightly: why not use the added light functionality to help locate objects inside these "boxes/shelves"? This defined the finalized version of my project.</p>

							My final product as in the video above is a set of independent "programmable" shelves; smart shelves. They connect to a computer via Arduino and using Matlab, I'm able to look up items on these shelves via a pre-programmed directory. Although the demonstration and implementation at this stage is quite simple, many levels of complexity. 

							Options to make this system more robust are:
								<ul>
									<li>Allowing the the interface between the computer and shelves be wireless instead of wired.</li>
									<li>Making the system cross-platoform.</li>
									<li>Allowing the objects to "dock" in place and automatically update the directory.</li>
									<li> ... and many other functionalities.</li>
								</ul>
